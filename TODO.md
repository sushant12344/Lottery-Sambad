# Fix 768px Mobile Centering Issue - COMPLETED

## Steps Completed:
- [x] Move 768px media query from nested position to root level in index.html
- [x] Enhance the .checknumberbtn styles for proper centering at 768px
- [x] Add parent container centering for .ticket-checker
- [ ] Test the fix by opening website at 768px width

## Changes Made:
1. Moved the 768px media query from being nested inside the 480px media query to the root level
2. Enhanced the .checknumberbtn styles with:
   - `margin: 0 auto !important` for horizontal centering
   - `display: block !important` to make it a block-level element
   - `width: fit-content !important` to prevent full-width stretching
3. Added `.ticket-checker { text-align: center !important }` to ensure parent container centers content

## Next Step:
Test the website at 768px width to verify the button is properly centered
